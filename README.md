# 5G-Infrastructure-investment

This report aims to predict New Zealand's growth areas for developing 5G infrastructure. The methods used to reach and support the findings are divided into Linear regression, Cluster and Forecast Analysis.
The Linear regression model highlights the factors contributing most to industrial GDP. Our analysis shows that these are the following factors that play a significant role in industrial GDP and can indicate the economic potential of that area:

  * The average number of active bonds
  *	Number of people aged 40-64 years old
  *	Total government spending in that area
  *	Total number of the following businesses in that area
      *	Financial and Insurance services
      *	Professional, Scientific, and Technical services
      *	Rental hiring and Real Estate Services

The cluster analysis shows areas with a similar growth pattern to Auckland's. This analysis highlights Tauranga City as an area with the highest industrial economic growth and the potential to remain a key growth area. This conclusion is further supported by a forecast analysis for the next ten years, which continued to show Tauranga City as a main growing area in the country. 
As a result of this analysis, it is recommended for Spark to focus on Tauranga City and explore the economic profile of areas in Tauranga City using the economic factors noted in the linear regression results. â€ƒ
